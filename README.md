I could not get any screenshott of this homework as I couldn't get the functions to run. 

The first function is for checking the array if a certain number is in it. This works by running the number through a loop to find the array's matching index. 

The second function asks the user to change any number in the array and then will output both the new number and the old one.

The third function simply creates a new array with one more elemental slot, copies the old array onto it, then adds the user's choice of integer at the end of the new array.

The fourth array asks the user to change a number, via the index, to zero.
